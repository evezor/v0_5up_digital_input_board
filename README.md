# 5up Digital Input Board
*please note this board has been deprecated.

An edge board containing five opto isolated inputs.  All inputs are active HIGH. Each input comes with an input pin, a 5v and a gnd connection. 

If I were to do this again, I would probably make a jumper that can switch between the 5v and whatever the bus voltage was.
